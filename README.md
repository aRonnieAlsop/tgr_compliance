# TGR Compliance Tracker

This project is a personal tool created to help organize **TGR compliance**. The application displays a weekly compliance schedule in the form of interactive cards that resemble file folder outlines. Each card represents a week from **July 29, 2024, to July 29, 2025**, with the ability to easily view and track compliance data over time.

## Project Structure

- **LandingPage.tsx**: The main page that displays a series of weekly cards. Each card represents a week with its start and end dates.
- **App.tsx**: The root component that renders the `LandingPage` component.
- **.....css**: Styling for the application, including the file folder-style cards and general layout.

## Features So Far

- **Weekly Compliance Schedule**: Displays weeks in the format **Sunday-Saturday** up until January 17, 2025, after which it switches to **Monday-Sunday**.
- **File Folder-Style Cards**: Each week is represented as a clickable card styled to look like a file folder with black borders and the **Courier Prime** font.
- **Responsive Layout**: The weeks are displayed in a flexible grid, adjusting the number of columns based on the screen size.

## Font

- **Courier Prime** is used for the text on the cards, providing a typewriter-style font.

## Future Enhancements

- This project is a work in progress, and more features will be added to track compliance data and organize the weeks more efficiently.

## Purpose

This project is for personal use to organize compliance tracking for TGR and is meant to provide an easy-to-use interface to see weekly data at a glance.
